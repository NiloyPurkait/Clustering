# Unsupervised Learning lessons

This repo contains two lesson tracks I made on key topics in unsupervised learning: **Dimensionality Reduction** and **Clustering**. Each track dives deep into the theory, mathematical foundations, and practical implementation using `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas` and `scipy`.

## Lesson Tracks Overview

### 1. Dimensionality Reduction
In this track, we explore various matrix factorization-based methods for reducing the dimensionality of data. The lessons include:

- **Theory and Mathematics**: Understand the mathematical concepts behind dimensionality reduction techniques based on matrix factorization and neighborhood graphs.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Learn how `PCA`, `Sparse PCA`, `Kernel PCA` reduce dimensionality while retaining variance and how to apply it using `scikit-learn`.
- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: Dive into NMF, a powerful technique for extracting meaningful features from non-negative data.
- **Practical Implementation**: Hands-on tutorials using `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn` to apply these techniques to real-world datasets.

### 2. Clustering
This track focuses on the theory and implementation of various clustering algorithms. The lessons cover:

- **Clustering Theory**: An overview of clustering concepts, including different clustering paradigms and how to evaluate clustering performance.
- **k-Means Clustering**: Learn the k-Means algorithm, including its assumptions, limitations, and practical usage.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Explore agglomerative and divisive hierarchical clustering methods.
- **DBSCAN**: Understand the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for discovering clusters in spatial data.
- **Other Clustering Algorithms**: A look at other clustering methods available in `scikit-learn`, such as Mean-Shift and Spectral Clustering.
- **Implementation in Python**: Tutorials on implementing and applying these clustering algorithms using `scikit-learn`.
